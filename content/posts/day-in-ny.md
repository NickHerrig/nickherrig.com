Traveling is one of my favorite hobbies. It's an entry point to experiencing other hobbies of mine, including trying new restaurants, enjoying entertainment, and sight seeing. It's also a chance to learn how to explore and operate in a new city. A few weeks ago I visited New York City for the first time. I was starting a new job and onboarding took place in the heart of Manhattan. After the week of onboarding I had a full day to experience a sliver of what downtown New York had to offer.

## Game Plan over Brunch

I started the day with a delicious brunch at [Friedmens](https://www.friedmansrestaurant.com/chelsea-menus/). There was a huge line and an hour wait, but since I was riding solo they sat me in 5 minutes. Score! It was tough to choose from their brunch menu but I ended up fueling up with some steak & eggs with a cold brew. While eating I pulled out my notes app and started to plot out my travel game plan to see some of the places on my list.

The Game Plan:

- The Empire State Building
- The 911 Memorial
- The Statue of Liberty
- Times Square
- Broadway

## Public Transportation

At first, trying to navigate New York subways seemed overwhelming. The winding rows of trains seemed to lead everywhere and nowhere all at once. It was a bit overwhelming the first time, but google maps came to the rescue.

Prior to traveling to New York, I always thought that Apple Maps was the premier navigation experience. Boy was I wrong! Google Maps crushed the public transportation game. The app knew everything from which side of the street to enter, while also maintaining real time schedule changes. It saved me a ton of stress.

## The Empire State Building

After finishing brunch and mapping out my sight seeing game plan, I walked the 10 minutes to my first stop. The Empire State Building stood tall and mighty before me. I decided to purchase the 102nd observation deck ticket, but in all honestly the 86th floor was equally as impressive. Standing on the NYC streets, it's hard to grok how large the concrete jungle is; but from the 102nd floor it's hard to ignore the impressive creation. If you squint, you can see The Statue of Liberty in the top right corner.

## 911 Memorial

My next stop was a sobering one. I took the subway 10 minutes in the south direction and quickly reached my destination; The 911 Memorial. On September 11th, 2001, 19 terrorists carried out four coordinated suicide attacks on the United States resulting in the death of 2,977 people. At 8:46 AM EST American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center leading to the eventual collapse of the building. At 9:03 AM EST, United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center leading to the collapse of the building. The memorial consists of the footprints of the original Twin Towers and are called the North Pool and South Pool.

I place this video here as a reminder of the chaos and loss of that day, it contains graphic content so viewer discretion is advised.

After paying my respects, and pondering the events of 911, it was time to move to my next destination. 

## The Statue of Liberty

Moving further south, my next stop was The Statue of Liberty. I decided to save an up close look for a future day, but the view from the lookout was incredible. I pondered that my grandparents parents both saw this Statue when the emigrated from Poland and Germany to find a better life in America for their families. What a sight to come across
