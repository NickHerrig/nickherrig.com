My wife Megan and I just returned from a 6 day adventure to Kauai Hawaii. It was incredible. There was so much to see, eat, and do that it was physically impossible to experience the full scope of what the island has to offer during our short visit. In an effort to remind myself of our stay, I thought it'd be a fun exercise to try and stack rank a few of the adventures we shared while exploring the garden island. It turned out to be harder than I thought ðŸ™ˆ!

## The Garden Island

Kauai, Hawaii is the oldest of the main Hawaian island chain. Around 5 Million years old ðŸ¤¯. It's also one of the smallest islands, coming in at 33 miles wide, and 25 miles long. Unlike some of Kauaii's larger neighbors, there are no active volcanos.  Mt WaiÊ»aleÊ»ale poured it's final drop of moltent lava around 500,000 years ago. The garden island get's its name from the incredibly lush rainforests, while also boasting rugged canyons and mountainous north shores.

### The Geography

Prior to the trip, Megan and I scouted out the island and came up with a loose game plan to help us efficiently explore(must be the Industrial Engineers in us ðŸ˜‚). We quickly discoverd that it was a sound strategy to split the island into 4 quadrants; north, sourth, east, and west. One thing to note is that due to the rugged landscape, roads do not connect the west and north sides of the island. This, paired with the fact that the main highway system runs perpendicular to the coast, means that if you want to travel from west to north, you've got a hell of a drive ahead. Speaking of driving, one thing I'd **strongly recommend** is renting a vehicle for your trip. Without a vehcile, exploring the island activies and food scene would have been challenging.

## The Resort

Although Kauai has a solid vacation rental scene, we opted for the slightly more expensive resort route. Staying at a resort meant that we were right on the beach, and had access to resort amenaties like a pool, hot tub, restaurant, and a clean room to come home to. We stayed at Ko'a Kea Resort on the south side of the island in Poipu. When we return to Kauai, we might look into doing a airbnb, but loved our stay at Ko'a Kea.

## Our Favorite Adventures

Although it's impossible to narrow it down, below are my favorite two adventures that we did. Since Megan and I love trying new food and restuarants on trips, I kept all mention of food in [Part Two (coming soon...)](/posts/kauai-hawaii-food) of this blog series. Let's get on with the adventures.

### Helicopter Ride

Every blog, youtube video, and conversation about Hawaii mentioned a helicopter ride. To be honest, I was a little sceptical. I debated the price tag. How could it be worth the money? Helicopter rides run a beefy price tag of around $400-$450 per seat. I humbely admit I was could not have been more wrong. It was worth every penny. We booked our helicopter tour with Blue Hawaian, as we wanted a trust worthly, door on experience. *"Door on??"* you might ask. Yes, you read that correctly. For the more adventurous and daring, you can opt for a helicopter ride with no doors. Our tour left from the Lihue airport located on the East side of the island.

The tour took us up the west coast, first over the port Hawaii where cruise ships make their home. From there we accended on old sugar cane fields owned by the Robinson family, a prominent land and island owning family. As we looked to our left, Niihau, also known as the Forbidden Island, could be seen in the distance. This island was purchased by the Robinson family in 1864 for 10,000 gold and a grand piano. In today's dollars, that's only $300,000; Not a bad deal for an island. Another interesting fact about the island, is that only natives are allowed, no tourists (hence the name forbidden).

From there, we headed towards Waimea Canyon. At this point, my jaw dropped, and remained dropped for the duration of the flight. The advantage of a helicopter, is you get an up close and personal view flying through the canyon. Waterfalls, lush green, and bright red iron soil engulfed the aircraft.

I questioned how it could get better than this. At that moment we headed out of the Canyon and in the direction of the infamous Na Pali coast. It was humbling, inspiring, and breathtaking. Something about a landscaping being formed and molded over millions of years puts your own existance into perspective.

From here, we headed back to the airport. The ride was about 50 minutes total. If you get a chance to visit Kauai, do not leave this adventure off your list.

### Na Pali Coast Boat Ride

After seeing the Na Pali Coast from air, we opted for a closer look at the coast line via a boat ride and snorkling adventure. There are a few great companies to choose from, but we ended up hanging out with Captain J's. The trip started with an early sighting of a pod of more than 20 bottlenose dolphins. The Captain said this was rare to see so many feeding at the same time, so we were gratful to have stumbled on them. While we ventured on, we made our way up west side of Kauai towards the Na Pali coastline. We were quickly greeted by impressive cave formations.

The coastline is hard to put into words without seeing it yourself. It's a 17 mile stretch of volcanic rocks, stunning cliffs, and lush greenery. It's inaccesible by road, however, can be accessed by the Kalalau trail. Sadly, due to weather, We weren't able to do this trail. The river was too high due to higher than noraml rainfall during our stay. The boat ride allowed us to get a different, less exhausting view.

On our way to the snorkling spot, we had another encounter with wildlife. This time, we spotted a group of humpback whales. The whales were showing their tails and fins, most likely in an attempt to impress the larger female of the group. It was a magical moment seening these large creatures. We finally made our way to our snorkling spot. Although Hawaii isn't known for coral reefs, the rock formations were filled with bright colored fish, including a red spotted octopus that Megan spotted in the water.
