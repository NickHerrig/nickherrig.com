## My story
In 2018, I made the decision that I would devote my life to learning, mastering, and shaping technology.
After getting a degree in Industrial Engineering, I quickly ditched that career path in favor of exploring software engineering, computer science, and the technology industry.
My thought was "What could possibly be more important than technology in the next 5, 10, 15, 50, 100 years?".
It is exciting to see the magnitude of problems that computer devices and software can solve, and I wanted to be a part of that story.
The other thought that crossed my mind was, "How hard could it be?".
Turns out, that was a pretty naive thought.
There is a ton of history and context.
There are also a ton of  tools, technologies, standards, programming languages, operating systems, etc.
It's a pretty complex and complicated world out there, and sifting through what is most important was a challenge for me.
That's where this blog series comes in to play.

## The Beginners Series
The beginners series is a blog series that assumes no formal computer science, software engineering, or computer engineering education.
It is the documenting of my journey to understanding how the computing world works.
It will tackle basic concepts from the ground up in hopes of breaking down barriers to getting started in technology. 
Rather than jumping into programming, containers, and other complex topics which depend on a plethora of  knowledge, we are going to start simple.
We are going to focus on bite sized concepts and understand from the ground up. 

## Who is the Series for?
This series is for a multitude of beginners:

+ The "Im new to computers" people
+ The self taught developer
+ The "How does this all work?" builder

This series is also for the non-beginners that want to learn from the ground up:
+ The "refresh me on this topic" Software engineers.
+ The "Technology has become so complex, can we simplify?" people.
