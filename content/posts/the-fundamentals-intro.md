A few weeks ago a friends partner reached out wanting some advice on learning to program and getting a job in the technology industry.

> "I'm currently a high school teacher (band director) and am looking to make the change to web development in the next year."

He was really excited about starting his career shift from a band director at the local high school to a hacker and software engineer.
The problem though, was that he didn't really know where to start.  He wanted to pick my brain about two things I've recently gone though. 

 - How does one make a shift from a non technology job to software engineering?
 - Where should I start?

When I first saw this email, I honestly had no clue how to respond. 
Sure, I recently transitioned from a career in manufacturing engineering to software engineering and developer. 
I was now automating distributed systems with [ansible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_%28software%29) , using time series data to monitor systems with [prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_%28software%29), and writing self service tools in [python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) with the [flask web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_%28web_framework%29).
I didn't really have a game plan at the time though. 
My game plan looked like giving it a try, and seeing how it worked out.
Luckily for myself, I had a lot of time to learn, and some great mentors to help me. 
But that didn't help the high school band teacher...
I thought about his situation for the next few weeks and tried to answer the questions:

 - What would I do differently if I was making a career shift to the technology industry?
 - Where would I start?

## The Fundamentals Blog Series

The fundamentals blog series is my answer to the above two questions.
It's my attempt to answer the high school band teachers questions about making the shift from non technical work to technical work.
The fundamentals, is a blog series about base computer science and technology concepts, and explaining them in a non convoluted context.
We will cover a variety of software engineering and computer science concepts, have a chat about them, and test our understanding together. 

## Audience
I'm writing this blog series for a few different people I've met over the years.

 - The high school band teacher looking to make a career shift.
- The 4 year graduate, wanting a refresher on the fundamentals.
- The person who thinks computers are too complicated to learn about.

It is my hope that more and more people realize that technology is just another language like English or Spanish. 
Sure it takes practice, but think of all the cool stuff we get to build together to make the world better. 

## Goal of Series
I have two major goals for the series

#### Motivate non-traditional developers to break into the technology industry
#### Have a conversation about technology concepts in a non-intimidating fashion 

The blog series was designed to be a conversation between two people about bite sized computer science topics.
Imagine that we are grabbing coffee, and while we are slamming that iced americano, or cappuccino we discussion bit shifting and why it's important. 
The goal is for the series to be a learning path and to break down the barriers for other folks to join the party. 
Any yes, it is a freaking party.

## What to Expect
Before you join me on this journey, lets chat expectations.
#### Each blog will be no more than 30 minutes.
We are all busy, so i'll be keeping the concepts contained.
The content will be  short, sweet, and concise. 

#### Testing your Understanding
Each blog will have an exercise to test your understanding of the main topic. 
Solutions will be on a separate, slightly hidden page, so try your best to answer the questions before peaking. 

#### No coding experience needed, but....
Although coding isn't a prerequisite, we will be reading some code.
The plan is to use a easy to read/use programming language to test understanding.
I'm taking [Paul Graham's advice](http://www.paulgraham.com/pfaq.html) here:
>**How can I learn to program?**    
Find a friend who knows how to program. Get them to set you up with a system where you can edit and run programs. Use whatever language they suggest for a beginner (probably it will be Python or Ruby).

## Let's do this!
