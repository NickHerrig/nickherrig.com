## Welcome Back Folks!
Welcome back to The Fundamentals blog series.
Where we have conversations about fundamental technology concepts in a non-intimidating fashion. 
The ultimate goal you might ask?
To learn, grow, and be better. 
If you haven't read the the fundamentals introduction post, feel free to [give it a skim](https://nickherrig.com/posts/the-fundamentals-intro/).
Let's get started!

### Before Reading
Today we will be using [Python3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) as our programming language of choice to work through examples and help us learn!
If you do not have Python3 installed, follow the [official Python docs](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install it on your particular computer! 
To check if you have Python3 run the command...
> python3 --version

## Todays Topic!
Todays funamentals blog topic is all about bits, bytes, and binary!
 - What are bits and bytes?
 - What is this thing called binary?
 - Why should I even care as a developer?

**I'm glad you asked!**

## Let's count to Ten
If I asked you to count to ten, you'd probably rattle off.
> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
But what if I started rattling off..
> 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010
Or even better...
> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a
Wait a minute, did you just use the letter 'a' instead of '10'?

YOUBETCHA...
Turns out, that counting needs a little bit more context.
So do other operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The context we are missing when we I ask you to "count to ten" is the number system.

## Binary
The truth is, that we've all been living a lie thanks to the public school system.

## Bits, the smallest unit of information.
A bit can be either 0 or 1. 
I'm not kidding, it's pretty straight forward. 

## Bytes
8 bits in a byte

## ASSCII Text
if computers only understand 1s and 0s, how am I reading this text?
