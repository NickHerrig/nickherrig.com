I've been thinking about writing more. If I'm being honest with myself, I've been considering writing more for a while. However, I haven't been writing, but this year I'm changing that. To make this change, I need to confront why I haven't written more in the past and what I hope to gain from writing in the future.

## What's been holding my writing back?
**Impostor syndrome** is something I've struggled with since writing my first Python script 6 years ago. This topic could, and probably should, be a full post in the future. Without a formal computer science education, sometimes my mind tricks me into thinking, "Am I really the best person to speak on technology?" This thought, combined with a hint of "I'm not a good writer," has held me back from writing more. So, what's different this time around?

## Why Write?
This time, I'm writing for myself. I'm writing to improve my writing, solidify my learning, and to share my knowledge with others.

### Improve my writing
Writing is important. It's a medium through which we share ideas, learn, and build. I want to share my ideas. I want to help others learn. I want to build important things. Improving my writing will help me achieve these goals.

### Solidify my learning
Writing helps me learn. I learn best by doing. Writing about technology, fitness, nutrition, golfing, fishing, and cooking will help me become better at the things I love in life.

### Share my knowledge
I've learned a lot from others sharing their experiences. Now, it's my turn to help others by sharing my knowledge.

## The 2024 Writing Challenge
This afternoon, I texted my good friend [Andrew](https://github.com/theandrew168) with an idea: a blog challenge.

The rules are simple:
1. One post a week, published on Sunday by midnight.

So here it goes, my first post of the 2024 writing challenge.
Why write? Well, that's really up to you.
