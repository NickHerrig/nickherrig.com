# Why Write?

I've been thinking about writing more. If I'm being honest with myself I've been thinking about writing more for a while. I haven't been writing though, and 2024 is the year I'm changing this. In order to change this though, I have to confront why I haven't written more in the past; and what I hope to get out of writing more in the future.

## What's been holding my writing back?

## 2024 writing challenge 

## What I hope to get out of writing

### Improving my writing.
### Solidifying Learning.
### Sharing my knowledge.
### Mirroring people who inspire me.
