In early February I wrote a post called [Kauai Hawaii - Part One: Adventures](/posts/kauai-hawaii-adventures/). Megan and I had just returned from an amazing 6 day adventure to Kauai, Hawaii and in that post I talked about some of the cool things we experienced. As I was writing that post I realized it would have been double the length if I included all of the amazing food we tried. I quickly concluded that I would need to write a new post devoted solely to the food we experienced. Here is my attempt at reliving the meals we enjoyed the most.

## Kauai Food

In Kauai, there are a diverse set of restruants ranging in styles, prices, and ambiance. There wasn't a restaurant that we didn't enjoy, but some stood out as our favorites. When I say that writing this post was very difficult, I mean it. It event caused a little writers block, as I didn't want to decide on my favorite spots for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and diner. With that being said, here is how i'm currently feeling ðŸ™ˆ.

### Favorite Breakfast Spot

In my opinion, choosing the [Tip Top Motel, Cafe, and Bakery](https://www.tiptop-motel.com/) as the number one breakfast spot was the easiest choice for me. This spot has been around for 107 years as of writing this blog post and was originally founded by a Plantation manager named Denjiro Ota 1916! It's an unassuming hole in the wall attached to a motel, and has both charm and character. I shit you not, this place had two of my favorite dishes I had on the entire trip.

The first is their homemade banana macnut pancakes. This recipe was created by the son of Denjiro named Mitchell after he took over the business in 1925. To this day, they still serve the same recipe.

 The second is their oxetail soup. This dish had a incredible mix of flavors. The oxtail was tender, fresh,  and delicous.

### Favorite Lunch Spot

Our favorite lunch spot had a little more compeition than our favorite breakfast spot. The [Koloa Fish Market](https://koloafishmarket.com/) came out ahead by a thread. This spot boasts the best poke bowls I've had in my life. Founded by the Matsuoka family 25 years ago right after Hurricane Iniki, you can tell they really care about quality. The location is off of Poipu road and is a simple walk up counter. They have a great selection of ahi tuna, salmon, marlin, and shrimp poke. Below is my ahi tuna poke bowl with edemame, ginger, ocean salad, and cucumber. I'd go back in a heartbeat.

### Favorite Snack Spot

When we weren't eating meals like breakfast and diner; we were eating snacks! [Kauai Kookie](https://www.kauaikookie.com/about/) was my favorite go to snack on the island. Founded in 1965 by Mabel Hashisaka with humble begginings, the business now bakes around 50,000 cookies and specialty items every single day! That's a lot of goodies... My personal favorite was the OG chocolate chip macadamia and the Kona Cofeee Shortbread!

### Favorite Diner Spot

The last on our list of favorites was [Tidepools](https://www.opentable.com/tidepools-grand-hyatt-kauai) at the [Grand Hyatt Resort](https://www.hyatt.com/grand-hyatt/en-US/kauai). To start, this resort was insanely huge and impressive. It reminded me a lot like a Vegas resort, where you have everything you'd ever need for an incredible vacation all on the resort grounds. Although the resturant was booked out for months, our concierge called in a favor and got us a reservation for two for my birthday diner ðŸ¥°. The resturant sits on a floating structure above a koi-filled lagoon at the base of a waterfall. They had an incredible menu with fresh fish and steak.
